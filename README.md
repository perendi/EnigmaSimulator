## Enigma Simulator

This program simulates the workings of the famous World War II. machine, the Enigma. This machine has only ever been used with the 26-letter standard English alphabet, however this simulator allows the user to use this fantastic machine with the Hungarian alphabet as well. The components of the Hungarian machine were exclusively generated for this project.

## How to run
The simulator can be launced on Windows machines via the `EnigmaSimulator.jar` runnable jar file.

## Folder Structure

The project contains two folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The project also contains a jupyter notebook, in which some experiments have been conducted with the Hungarian language and its Index of Coincidence.

## Creator

This project is created by Daniel Matyas Perendi under the supervision of Dr. Prosanta Gope.
